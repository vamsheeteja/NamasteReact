Lecture -6 Finding the Path..

* ADD NEW CSS STYLES

Config Driven UI
Any config can power the UI

Hooks
When you want to create Local variables in a React component you have to use a STATE VARIABLES useState() (HOOKS).

What is DOM at EOD ? 
its a big JS object.

Why React is FAST ?
It is because of its fast DOM manipulation

How it has faster dom manipulation - bcoz it has a super powerful DIFF algo React FIBER.

React track the variables which are local STATE varibles (created using useState())

named import
import {useState} from "react";


#1 Header.js

change Title tilt and State variable change testing..

import { useState } from 'react' -- added

const Title = () => (
  <a href="/">
    <img
      className="logo"
      alt="logo"
      src="https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu_EC-ECXAxRAixWGEfMsE1rdSoetBHyxmLNdtCB=s900-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj"
    />
  </a>
)

const Header = () => {
  const [title, setTitle] = useState('Food Villa')

  // Whenever we change the STATE VARIABLE React does a KIND of REFRESHES THE COMPONENT. ==========================
  // the whole Component gets re-rendered when some is changed in a STATE VARIABLE.==========================
  console.log('render()')

  return (
    <div className="header">
      <Title />
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          title === 'Food Villa'
            ? setTitle('Namaste Restaurants')
            : setTitle('Food Villa')
        }}
      >
        Change Title
      </button>
      <div className="nav-items">
        <ul>
          <li>Home</li>
          <li>About</li>
          <li>Contact</li>
          <li>Cart</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Header // We can just export default only one time.

#2=================
Body.js

      <div className="search-container">
        <input
          type="text"
          className="search-input"
          placeholder="Search"
          value={searchText}
          // BINDING MY STATE VARIABLE TO INPUT BOX. whenever my input gets modified on ui it will be displayed on UI on every change.  +++++
            // YOU CAN SEE IN DEV TOOLs IN => index.html header -> value attribute +++
          onChange={(e) => {
            setSearchText(e.target.value)
          }}
        />

Microservices: There are 100s of Microservices in a Real time project.

In older days -----

The project was containing all the things like API, UI was inside the API, Backend everything was inside only ONE project. SMS sending, notification, 
authentication, UI all was in same folder/project. known as Monolithic Architecture.

- to change one button we were to deploy whole project.

- so in Microservices instead of having just ONLY one project we have small small different Projects.

- UI , Backend, API, Notification, Logs, Authentication project 

- there can be 10 ui projects, 20 backend project and many more 

- every project can be hosted on different ports..

- every project may use different Languages based on performance/ dependends on BEST USECASE..

- ui can be written in React, backend api using Java, Notification using Python, logs using Golang, authentication Golang

-- All these applications are connected through different Ports
        /
        /dapi
        /notifications

Advantages of Microservices
    Seperation of Concern or Single Responsibility : every small microservices have their own work to do, they donot bother about other microservices

* Easy to Maintain
* to testing

-- Now we'll Explore the World : Talk to different apis

1:15:00

- fetch: it comes from `window`. This is available to us from js engines window.
fetch(api)  - passed api and it calls that api.

Q) WHERE SHOULD WE CALL MY API? WHERE WE NEED OUR API?


Types of loaading API

user loads the website  -->  Api call  --> render page..
                            300ms to call api  200ms             so total 300 + 200 = 500ms

user loads the page   -->  render the initial page (loading)  -->  api call  --> update UI
                                100ms                               300ms          200ms         500ms

2nd is ui bcoz the page is available very quickly

The best part of React is its Reconcilation algorithm

To make this functionality HAPPEN, React gives access to the 2nd most import hook : `useEffect()`

# 3 Body.js

  // useEffect() is a function that we'll call by passing another function (callback) to it. It will be called whenever useEffect wants it to be called.
  // and React will make sure it will be called at specific time.
  // What specific time?
  // When ever my props changes or state changes my component will re-rendered, whenever it re-renders after every rerender this useEffect it called.
  // But we dont want to call it after every re-render. So to make this happen pass an Empty dependency array.
  // Suppose i want to call this useEffect when ever my searchText changes, then write searchText inside the dependency array. This means my useEffect is dependent on searchText

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('call this when dependency is changes')
  }, [searchText])

  # 3.1
    // useEffect() is a function that we'll call by passing another function (callback) to it. It will be called whenever useEffect wants it to be called.
  // and React will make sure it will be called at specific time.
  // What specific time?
  // When ever my props changes or state changes my component will re-rendered, whenever it re-renders after every rerender this useEffect it called.
  // But we dont want to call it after every re-render. So to make this happen pass an Empty dependency array.
  // Suppose i want to call this useEffect when ever my searchText changes, then write searchText inside the dependency array. This means my useEffect is dependent on searchText
  // Empty dependency array, It will call the useEffect after the render

  // dep array [searchText] once after initial render + everytime after my render (searchText changes)
  // So this useEffect is for API call. Api call should be called once after our render.

  // useEffect will make my api call (after render) and it will re-render my component.

  useEffect(() => {
    // API call
    getRestaurants()
  }, [])

  // the call happens aynchronously
  async function getRestaurants() {
    const data = await fetch(
      'https://www.swiggy.com/dapi/restaurants/list/v5?lat=17.310302&lng=78.518064&page_type=DESKTOP_WEB_LISTING',
    )
    const json = await data.json()
    console.log(json)
  }

  const authenticateUser = () => {
  // API call to check authentication
  return true

  console.log('render()')
